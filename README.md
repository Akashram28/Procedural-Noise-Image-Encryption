# Procedural Noise based Image Encryption

This Python tool allows you to encrypt and decrypt an Image based on an initial seed. It utilizes the PIL (Python Imaging Library) to manipulate images.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Akashram28/Procedural-Noise-Image-Encryptio
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Install the required Python packages by running:
        ```
        pip install pillow
        ```

## Usage
1. **Run the Application:**
   Run the Python file `main.py`:
        ```
        python main.py
        ```

3. **Using the Application:**
    - Run the script main.py.
    - Enter the path to the input image.
    - Enter the path for the output image.
    - Enter a seed for reproducibility.
